                            As a clerk in National Service, one of my jobs was to collate the attendances of everyone in office every day. When we did it manually, it took a lot of time, as we had to hunt down our superiors, and await their replies of attendance slowly. At this time, I had just learned Python, and decided this would be the first practical project I could do. This bot is designed to message all users at a specific time for attendance, and continue to message them if they do not reply.

                            I did this before I learned of CSV files, so I reinvented the wheel in making a file text format for persistent memory, a rather fragile database of 9 lines of data per person separated by newlines. In future projects, I'll instead use better database systems such as SQL or CSV, but I'm still proud of what I managed without the awareness of such systems

                            I learned a lot from this project. Many problems in our world have very simple solutions, we just have not realised that there are solutions with what tools we have. Take the wheel for example. In hindsight, it was a very simple idea. But at the time, only a few had what was needed to devise it in their minds. This realization humbled me and gave me respect for other ideas and applications I found boring, or looked down on.

                        <p>
                            It also taught me the value of my work. I gave the program to my office for free, and hosted it on my own computer 24/7. This was because I thought such a simple, lightweight program wasn't worth charging for. The many days spent educating them on usage or on bugfixing or creating improvements have taught me otherwise. It also gave me an appreciation for open source programs being maintained by others, free of charge. While this doesn't mean I will charge for my work now onwards, it means I will properly value my own work as well, and not downplay my own worth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Adapting the program, which used to run locally on a Raspberry Pi, for usage with the Heroku system also taught me much about adapting to others' frameworks and utilising them well.

                            My first 3D printer was a Da Vinci MiniMaker, given to me for free. However, I was very frustrated with it, as the company had prevented the usage of other filaments with NFC tags as well as locked the 3d printer to a painfully limied, proprietary Model Slicer (a program to convert 3D models into instructions for the machine). Hence, I quickly got a new, more open-source printer, and tore the Da Vinci printer apart, removing all proprietary elements to rebuild it anew, so that It would play well with 3rd party filaments and software.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had to model new pieces for the printer to accomodate for open source parts, whose designs were different as compared to their proprietary complements. The wiring, power supply and control board were all replaced by myself as well, as even the most common 3D printing hardware today <i>far</i> outshines the original parts from 6 years ago.

                            As each new part was individually sourced, ironically, as compared to the replacement 3D Printer I bought, which is still more reliable than my revamped Da Vinci printer, this custom printer was far more expensive to make. A real life experience of economies of scale - one custom device is likely much more expensive per unit as compared to mass produced versions of it. I also gained some experience with 3D modeling, editing as well as experience with electric systems.

                            Zero G is a 6 degrees-of-freedom first person shooter set in a zero-gravity environment. At it's heart, was made to investigate how our descendants, as part of a fully-fledged space-faring civilization in the far future, would move about in space. That question molded the game mechanics that comprise the backbone of this game. This idea has been floating around in my head for a very long time. However, I realised that such a game could be easily turned into a (if not fun, at least interesting) FPS game. It may not be the first of its kind (I'm quite excited for Boundary when it comes out) but I sought to create a simple game that could help solidify that idea of movement in space. CS50 gave me the inspiration to finally create that game.

                            One current limitation of the game is its simplistic models, and lack of sound. I do not have prior experience with 3D modelling, so I was unable to provide anything of the sort in the time I challenged myself to complete this. I'd like to say that the lack of sound is intentional, since there is no sound in space, however it was due to a lack of time and knowledge on where to find good resources as well. Future releases of ZERO G will have these implemented. C# is also my first taste of object-oriented-programming. While I learned a lot from it, much of the code is inefficent because of a lack of experience with it, especially with access modifiers. As I learned more effecient methods to solve problems with different methods provided by the Unity Engine, I tried to rewrite previous code to match. However, large parts of the code are written with different mindsets and ways to solve the same issues, as I was unable to catch some of these before they became essential to not breaking other parts of the code. At the very least, I believe I have rewritten it enough to implement multiplayer slightly easier now.
