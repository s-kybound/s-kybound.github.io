                            The future is going to be rather difficult for our race. Many of our problems now are caused by our inability to quickly adapt (as a species) to massive, powerful change, or even to detect it. Take, for example, our industrial revolution. we grew dependent on our machines long before we realised that it was polluting the earth, and by then, we were too dependant to cut off such machines completely. Our actions up to now have created heavy consequences we must shoulder now and in the future to survive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Humanity isn't losing the war to prevent or undo climate change. <i>We've already lost.</i> Irreversible damage to our planet and its ecosystem has been done. There is no undoing what has been done. Even if we were to find a way to restore our climate, or slow/stop its destruction, such solutions will take time to take effect, and we will have to face these changes until then. Ways to alleviate the effects on our species and ensure our long-term survival and prosperity are desparately needed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'd be happy to be proven wrong.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our population is growing, and soon (maybe even already) our planet will be unable to care for all of us. Soon enough, we will need to begin the permanent colonisation of Earth orbit, Luna and so on. At the very least, this could alleviate the population growth of Earth, and also help in ensuring we will be capable of surviving, even away from our planet. Perhaps the development of space elevators, or improvements on propulsion or survival systems could help.
                        </p>

                            The rapid explosion of computing power has given us great opportunities. Even this simple, rudimentary website I am typing on now was considered a miracle 50 years ago. Now, however, we could employ these systems to help us better manage ourselves. I am aware that having an AI play a part in managing our lives has great moral implications, and will take a lot of deliberation and trust to implement correctly and unbiasedly. However, AI managing lesser aspects could, feasibly be done.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am not immortal. I won't be able to further and lead in every one of these subjects, and more. However, I hope that even the smallest scrap of what I <i>could</i> do in my life in my interests of computer science and engineering may be of some help <i>somewhere</i> down the line.

                            Currently, I'm just a student with a love for computer science, 3D printing, building contraptions and space. In the future, I'd like to contribute in the fields of AI development and robotics engineering
